# Personality-Prediction-using-big-five-traits

Personality is useful for recognizing how people lead, influence, communicate, collaborate,
negotiate business and manage stress. Personality is one of the important main features that
determines how people interact with the outside world. This project is helpful where we have data
related to personal behaviour. This personal behaviour data can be useful for identifying a person
based on his/her personality traits. The personality characteristics will be already stored in the
database. Later when user enters his personality characteristics his personality is examined in
database and system will detect the personality of user, It is based on Big Five Personality Traits
Personality is one feature that determines how people interact with the outside world. This data can
be helpful to classify persons using Automated personality classification (APC). This learning can
now be used to classify/predict user personality based on past classifications. This system is useful
to social networks as well as various ad selling online networks to classify user personality and sell
more relevant ads. This system will be helpful for organizations as well as other agencies who
would be recruiting applicants based on their personality rather than their technical knowledge. In
this project, we propose a system which analyses the personality of an applicant.
